# Introduction 

This is the Introduction, giving very clever reasons for doing this. 

## Background 

Fatigue and it management are well recognised in the airline industry, with refs galore. Principles of roster construction, assessment of fatigue and mandatory periods away from operational duties have reduced the frequency and impact of fatigue on routine operations, apparently. 

The impacts of fatigue are less well explored in medicine. Little data exists on the use of tools comparable to those used in aviation. Aeromedical retrieval offers a convenient way to study the reporting characteristics of those tools among medical staff, in an organisation which maintains current policies on fatigue reporting among its flight crew. I reckon.

## Aims 

1. To describe the outputs of a fatigue monitoring tool in aeromedical retrieval doctors. 

2. To estimate the necessary characteristics of a future randomised controlled trial examining various inputs to fatigue, including roster pattern and mandatory down time. 

# Literature Search 

Wherein the strategy and exciting results are described. 

## Initial Concepts 

Fatigue itself, management in the airline industry. Fatigue in madicine, political angles. Any efforts in medicine. 

Roster-fu. 

## Search strategy 

Databases searched, grey literature types considered. 

Actual search strings. 

Actual google terms and such like. 

## Search results 

The numbers and types found at first search, rejected, read, included here. 


# Literature Review 

Preamble and general conclusions then  

- list of 

- concepts 

- and approaches tried so far 

## Concepts one by one  

Each dealt with not too deeply but with some clarity to explain the next steps needed.

## and not too many concepts in total 

because that would have the reviewers tired before the actual report 

## And then a summary 

Which is distinct from the summary at the top by having the conclusions that the next steps needed are ... whatever they might be. 

# Survey Construction 

We did a survey among whoever, to do something. 

## Participants 

Justifications for who is included.

Inclusions 

1. in a 

2. numbered list 

Exclusions 

1. you get 

2. the picture 
  - and you can nest them, too 

## Question development 

The construct being estimated by each potential answer, and the future use of that construct in deciding whether there is a problem or in solving that problem. 

Then the questions in a list. 

## Deployment 

Survey Monkey or do you have an Australian version? Everyone likes Australian versions. 

Response Rate increasing mechanisms. 

# Survey Results 

Survey results. 

## And analysis

Of ... the results I guess.


# Design for a Randomised Trial 

Definition of an individually randomised crossover trial of different roster types and feasibility. 

## Hypothesis 

Formed from the paper so far: roster A is superior to roster B in an outcome, without being inferior in other important outcomes. 

## Correlated measures and the need for crossover 

As it says. 

## Acceptability 

Among rosterers and the rostereds. Consent for randomisation, alternative arrangements if not consenting, relative acceptability of either. 

## Feasibility 

Including callback and TOIL effects on total available roster hours, any need to cover emergency leave and the resulting effects on the trial's power. 

Cost. 

## Exposures 

Detailed description of the rosters to which to be randomised, the washout period ( _eg_ booked leave) and the method of application. 

## Outcome measures 

Fatigue, how measured? Self report? need for proxy or automated measures of fatigue effects such as reaction time? 

Popularity, by best-worst scoring? 

by ranking? 

by utility function balancing fatigue and therefore feelings of safeness in work against home time and clinical exposure? 

## Sources of bias 

1. RCTs balance, in the long run, for observed and unobserved confounders present at the time of enrollment but not for those that are not present at the time of enrollment. 

Such things introduce bias. 

_eg_, roster A might be really bad for fatigue on shift, but popular because it gives time off between shifts. Those on roster A might sleep heavily and be only as tired as those on other rosters, knowing that they are only on the roster for a month. This can't be controlled, only acknowledged, and the need for monitoring emphasised in the report. 

2. If the measures of fatigue are self reported then doctors may do what doctors always do and underreport; if this is differential in favour of roster A then a false positive will be made more likely. 


# Discussion 

of the results and the next steps. 

# Conclusion

To infinity and beyond.


## Outcomes 

- Paper on **fatigue tool** outputs 

- Paper on cluster characteristics and feasibility for RCT 

- Paper on the pilot 

- Paper on the RCT 

- Systematic review before the pilot?
