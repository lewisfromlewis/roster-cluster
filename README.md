# roster-cluster 

## Background 

Fatigue and it management are well recognised in the airline industry. Principles of roster construction, assessment of fatigue and mandatory periods away from operational duties have reduced the frequency and impact of fatigue on routine operations.
The impacts of fatigue are less well explored in medicine. Little data exists on the use of tools comparable to those used in aviation. Aeromedical retrieval offers a convenient way to study the reporting characteristics of those tools among medical staff, in an organisation which maintains current policies on fatigue reporting among its flight crew.

## Aims 

1. To describe the outputs of a fatigue monitoring tool in aeromedical retrieval doctors. 

2. To estimate the necessary characteristics of a future randomised controlled trial examining various inputs to fatigue, including roster pattern and mandatory down time.

## Methods 

Surveys on acceptability of random roster pattern allocation, structured fatigue reporting and chart feedback.
Estimation of cluster effects within person and within cohort.
Modelling of future cluster RCTs.
Feasibility assessment of the proposed RCT.

## Outcomes 

- Paper on **fatigue tool** outputs 

- Paper on cluster characteristics and feasibility for RCT 

- Paper on the pilot 

- Paper on the RCT 

- Systematic review before the pilot?
