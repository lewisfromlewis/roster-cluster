# Literature Review 

Preamble and general conclusions then  

- list of 

- concepts 

- and approaches tried so far 

## Concepts one by one  

Each dealt with not too deeply but with some clarity to explain the next steps needed.

## and not too many concepts in total 

because that would have the reviewers tired before the actual report 

## And then a summary 

Which is distinct from the summary at the top by having the conclusions that the next steps needed are ... whatever they might be.
